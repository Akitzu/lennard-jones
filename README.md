# Molecular Dynamics of a Lennard-Jones liquid
Run simulations for molecular dynamics of a Lennard-Jones liquid. The possibility of multiple choices of thermostat as well as the use of other integration schemes is implemented. 

## Compilation
The project compilation need OpenMP parralelism. The version of g++ and python used where : <br />
- g++ : (x86_64-posix-seh-rev1, Built by MinGW-W64 project) 12.2.0
- python : 3.10.8
